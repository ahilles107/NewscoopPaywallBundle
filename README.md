Newscoop Paywall Bundle is a simple and powerful plugin that allows online publishers to monetize their content.

Features:
=====================

- creating publication, issue, section, article aware subscriptions,
- email notifications,
- ordered subscription management,
- discounts (supports percentage discounts at the moment),
- possibility to define subscription duration/period (supports `months` option at the moment),
- supports diffrent currencies
- renewals
- imports live exchange rates from Central European Bank and Central Bank of Azerbaijan
- partial support for subscriptions' translations (subscription name and description is translatable)
- API
- smarty functions (see `Samples` section below)

This plugin realizes only "offline" payments, there is no payment gateways implementation yet, which can be used at the moment. However, there is a PayPal integration built-in.

In the future, this plugin will integrate a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment processing library called [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay).
